            <li><strong>Make crust:</strong> Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>

            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
